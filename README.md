# C# Learning Repository

Welcome to my second GitHub repository, dedicated to learning and practicing **C#** programming.  
This space is where I document my journey, test ideas, and explore various features of the C# language.

## ðŸ“˜ What's Inside

- Basics of C# â€“ syntax, variables, loops, conditionals
- Object-Oriented Programming â€“ classes, inheritance, interfaces
- Practice projects and coding exercises
- Experiments with .NET features

## ðŸŽ¯ Goal

This repository serves as my personal learning lab. It's not about polished production code â€“ it's about growth, trial and error, and building knowledge through hands-on experience.
